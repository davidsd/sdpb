# SDPB

SDPB is an open-source, arbitrary-precision, parallelized semidefinite
program solver, designed for the conformal bootstrap. It solves the following problem:

Let $S^{m\times m}[x]$ be the space of symmetric $m\times m$ matrices whose entries are polynomials in $x$.

- Given:
  - A collection of $J\times (N+1)$ polynomial matrices $M_{nj}(x) \in S^{m_j\times m_j}[x]$, ($j=1,\dots,J$ and $n=0,\dots,N$),
  - A constant $b_0 \in \mathbb{R}$,
  - A vector $b\in \mathbb{R}^N$,
- Maximize $b_0 + b\cdot y$ over decision variables $y\in \mathbb{R}^N$
- Such that: $M_{0j}(x) + \Sigma_{n=1}^N y_n M_{nj}(x) \succeq 0$ for all $x\geq 0$ and $j=1,\dots,J$.

Here, $M\succeq 0$ means "M is positive semidefinite."

For more information, see [A Semidefinite Program Solver for the Conformal Bootstrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02033)
and [the manual](/docs/SDPB_Manual/SDPB-Manual.pdf).

## Installation and Usage

The easiest way to run SDPB on a Windows or Mac machine is to follow
the [Docker instructions](docs/Docker.md).  For Linux and HPC centers,
the [Singularity](docs/Singularity.md) instructions will probably work
better.  If you want to build it yourself, there are detailed
instructions in [Install.md](Install.md).

Usage instructions are detailed in [Usage.md](docs/Usage.md).

Two python wrappers for SDPB are available:

- [PyCFTBoot](https://github.com/cbehan/pycftboot) by Connor Behan ([arXiv:1602.02810](http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1602.02810))
- [cboot](https://github.com/tohtsky/cboot) by Tomoki Ohtsuki ([arXiv:1602.07295](http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1602.07295)).

An unofficial Haskell wrapper is available:

Spectrum extraction was originally written for use in:

- Versions 2 and 3 of SDPB were made possible by support from the [Simons Collaboration on the Nonperturbative Bootstrap](http://bootstrapcollaboration.com/).

- The design of SDPB was partially based on the solvers [SDPA](http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/) and SDPA-GMP, which were essential sources of inspiration and examples.

- Thanks to Filip Kos, David Poland, and Alessandro Vichi for collaboration in developing semidefinite programming methods for the conformal bootstrap and assistance testing SDPB.

- Thanks to Amir Ali Ahmadi, Hande Benson, Pablo Parrilo, and Robert Vanderbei for advice and discussions about semidefinite programming.

- Thanks also to Noah Stein, who first suggested the idea of semidefinite programming to me in [this Math Overflow question](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/33242/continuous-linear-programming-estimating-a-solution).
