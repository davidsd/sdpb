# SDPB Input Format

`SDPB` takes preprocessed input generated by `pmp2sdp`.
If you want to modify these files or generate your own input files
with a separate tool, this documents the format you will need to follow.

`pmp2sdp` generates a main zip file containing multiple
JSON/binary files. It does not enable compression, because that can be quite
slow.  Putting everything into a single file makes it easier to
manage.  Also, the zip format has a built-in checksum to detect
corruption.

Inside the zip file, `SDPB` expects to find `control.json`,
`objectives.json`, and two files for every block: `block_info_0.json`, `block_data_0.bin` (or `block_data_0.json`),
`block_info_1.json`, `block_data_2.bin`, ...

The main part of `control.json` is listing the number of blocks.
`pmp2sdp` will also include a copy of the command used
to create the files, but `SDPB` does not require that.

`objectives.json` includes the constant contribution to the objective,
and 'b', the optimization vector.

`block_info_XXX.json` contains the dimension and number of points.

`block_data_XXX.bin` or `block_data_XXX.json` contains bilinear
bases, the 'B' matrix, and the 'c' vector.
Block data can be stored either in a human-readable JSON format, or in a more efficient binary format (which
uses [Boost.Serialization](http://boost.org/libs/serialization) library,
see [write_block_data.cxx](../src/pmp2sdp/write_block_data.cxx) for details).

`SDPB` can also read the input if you pack these files into different
archive formats.  It is limited by the support for
[libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki/LibarchiveFormats),
but it includes zip, tar, tar.gz, 7z.  If you like, you can also leave
everything in a plain old directory.

The JSON schema for these input files are in
[sdp_control_schema.json](json_schema/sdp_control_schema.json),
[sdp_objectives_schema.json](json_schema/sdp_objectives_schema.json),
[sdp_block_info_schema.json](json_schema/sdp_block_info_schema.json),
[sdp_block_data_schema.json](json_schema/sdp_block_data_schema.json). Running `SDPB` on the
test example

    pmp2sdp --precision 1024 -i test/data/pmp2sdp/xml/pmp.xml -o test/out/pmp2sdp/sdp.zip
    
will generate a simple example you can look at.
