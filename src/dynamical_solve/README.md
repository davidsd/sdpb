# Notes
1. The external_step is scaled by dual_step_length at the very end of dynamical_step.cxx.
2. The hessians and gradients are printed out around line 205 in dynamical_step.cxx. Running on multiple cores will gives several copies of these lines and can make the log file rather messy. 
3. More detailed comments can be found within the files. 

# Updates
1. By choosing the a higher precision when approximating the OPE vector in the haskell input, we solved the resolution problems with the hessians and gradients. For now, we require that ```theta``` is given as a BigFloat of 512 bits and the OPE vector is approximated by a closeby rational with the resolution ```e^(-200)```

```
approxRational 1e-200 <$> toV (cos theta, sin theta)
```
With this setup, we found that choosing alpha step size anywhere from e^-20 to e^-70 gives good approximations to the derivatives. 

2. After correcting some sign errors, we found a primal_dual optimal solution at the minimum in the external parameter (theta in this example) after ~300 iterations. Choosing the minimum external step size to be e-7, that is we do not update sdps when the step size calculated is less than e-7, We have  
     ```
     primalObjective = -0.00119771939664...
     ```
     after 310 iterations in total.

   The BFGS algorithm that started from the same initial conditions took 782 iterations in total to arrive at  
   ```
   primalObjective = -0.00119614134740... 
   ```
   and 855 iterations in total to arrive at
   ```
   primalObjective = -0.00119770961688...
   ```
   (Whether the paramters I used was optimal for the BFGS algorithm is not clear to me, but I believe that the algorithm has hot-starting implemented) 

3. I'm now working on finding the boundary of the island rather than the minimum of the navigator function. These lines are commented out in the lastest commit.
